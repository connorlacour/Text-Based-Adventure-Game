The only light in the foyer is from the two large windows in 
the southern wall.  Not wanting anyone outside to see you in 
the building, you let your eyes adjust to the dim light and 
take in your surroundings.  Looking around the room, you see a 
sitting area with CHAIRS and a SMALL TABLE in one corner.  The 
vacant greeter's DESK is positioned just to the side of the 
entrance to the house.  A door in the NORTH wall leads the 
DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY while a door in the EAST wall contains a 
door leading to a CLOSET visitor's can hang their coats.
Two doors lead out of the room and further into the building: 
one in the NORTH wall that goes to the DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY and . 
one in the EAST wall leading to a CLOSET..

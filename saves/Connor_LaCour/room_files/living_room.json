Despite the FIREPLACE set in the WEST wall directly across from the EAST HALLWAY door, the room is cold.  Above the FIREPLACE is a curved blade.  It is a traditional KATANA.  The furniture in the room consists of a large sectional and two modern wingback chairs.  A second door leading to the DINING ROOM sits in the NORTH wall.\n\nThe furniture looks rigid and barely used.  It is a living room, but there is not much life in it.  The only sign that anyone had been in the room is a coffee table with coasters and a STRIP OF PAPER.", "short_description": "You are in the living room.

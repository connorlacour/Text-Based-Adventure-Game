Surrounded by the shining silver appliances feels akin to being in a wall of mirrors in its own way.  There's a door in the WEST wall leading to the DINING ROOM and a second one in the SOUTH wall to the DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY.  There's an occasional beep from the MICROWAVE, which is embedded in the EAST wall above the countertop.  A brown paper bag is on the counter underneath it.\n\nA few feet in front of the EAST wall is an ISLAND counter.  There's a bowl of fruit and a bright blue jar on the ISLAND.  These are the only pop of color in the otherwise white and silver room.", "short_description": "You are in the kitchen.

The darkness of the hallway leaves you feeling uneasy.  Unlike the downstairs which had felt almost deserted, you have the feeling you are not entirely alone on this floor.\n\nThe two doors in the NORTH wall lead to a MAIN BEDROOM and a GUEST BEDROOM while the two doors in the SOUTH wall lead to a STUDY and a HOME GYM.  You can hear faint whimpering sounds coming from the STUDY.  Between the doors of the SOUTH wall hangs a LARGE POSTER.  It hangs at eye level and takes up a significant portion of the wall between the doors.  In contrast, a smaller ALARM is set between the two NORTH doors.",

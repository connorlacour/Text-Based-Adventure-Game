The darkness of the hallway leaves you feeling uneasy.  Unlike the downstairs which had felt almost deserted, you have the feeling you are not entirely alone on this floor.\n\nThere are four rooms on this floor. The door in the NORTHWEST wall leads to a MAIN BEDROOM while the one in the NORTHEAST wall goes to a GUEST BEDROOM. The door in the SOUTHWEST wall lead to a STUDY and another in the SOUTHEAST wall to a HOME GYM.  You can hear faint whimpering sounds coming from the STUDY.  Between two of the doors hangs a LARGE POSTER.  It hangs at eye level and takes up a significant portion of the wall between the doors.  In contrast, a smaller ALARM is set between the two other doors.",

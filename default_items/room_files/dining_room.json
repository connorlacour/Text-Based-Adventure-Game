To the side of the cabinet, you see a 4 hook WALL MOUNT.  You imagine stuffy business meetings are the most common dinner parties, but it would be a lovely room for family and friends to share a meal.  There's a door in the SOUTH wall to the LIVING ROOM and another in the EAST wall goes to the KITCHEN.",
